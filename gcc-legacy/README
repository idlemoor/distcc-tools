This SlackBuild repackages old versions of the gcc compilers from previous
versions of Slackware. It is intended to be installed on a distcc server, for
use by distcc clients running other versions of Slackware. With this package
installed, the distcc server will be able to build multiple versions of gcc.

By default, the SlackBuild will repackage gcc from Slackware 14.1 and 14.0.
To specify which Slackware versions should be repackaged, specify the VERSION
environment variable when running the SlackBuild.  Multiple Slackware versions
should be separated by '+', for example

  VERSION="14.1+14.0" ./gcc-legacy.SlackBuild

The gcc-legacy package does not conflict with Slackware's own gcc packages.

clang/clang++ legacy versions are not supported.
