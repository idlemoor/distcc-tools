This is a 'masquerade mode' distcc server.

The server and the clients should all have the same versions of Slackware
(i.e. all running 14.1, or all running the same revision of -current).

On x86_64 only, the server optionally supports cross compilation (see below).
Only one running instance of distccd is required.

To have the distccd daemon start automatically on boot, please add the following
lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.distccd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.distccd start
  fi


Cross-compiling server running Slackware 64 (x86_64)
----------------------------------------------------

To compile for Slackware 64 (x86_64) clients, and to cross-compile for 32 bit
Slackware clients (i486 etc), you don't need to do anything :-)

To cross-compile for Slackware ARM clients, you need to specify the option
'ARMX=yes' and install the arm-x-toolchain package.
