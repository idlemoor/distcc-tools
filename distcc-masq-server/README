This package sets up a 'masquerade mode' distcc server for gcc (including g++,
objc and gfortran) and clang/clang++.

The server and the clients should all have the same versions of Slackware
(i.e. all running 14.1, or all running the same revision of -current).

To start the distccd daemon automatically on boot, you must add these lines in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.distccd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.distccd start
  fi

On x86_64 only, the server supports full multiarch cross compilation -- it can
build for i486 and x86_64, and for arm if the arm-x-toolchain package is
installed.  Only one running instance of distccd is required.

To compile for Slackware 64 (x86_64) clients, and to cross-compile for 32 bit
Slackware clients (i486 etc), you don't need to do anything.  Slackware's
64 bit gcc packages already support 32 bit cross-compilation :-)

To cross-compile for Slackware ARM clients, you need to specify the option
'ARMX=yes' and install the arm-x-toolchain package (gfortran not supported).
