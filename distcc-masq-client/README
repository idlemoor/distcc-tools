This is a 'masquerade' mode distcc client for both gcc/g++ and clang/clang++.

After installation, please configure your client by editing the file
/etc/distcc/hosts -- you should change '127.0.0.1' to the distcc host
specification that you require.  Alternatively, you can override this on
a per-user basis by setting DISTCC_HOSTS in the user's profile, for example

  export DISTCC_HOSTS="bighost/4 tinyhost"

For details of the format of /etc/distcc/hosts and DISTCC_HOSTS, see
'man distcc', section 'HOST SPECIFICATIONS'.

To disable distcc within a process, you can unset the DISTCC_HOSTS environment
variable.

For a full description of 'masquerade' mode, see
