This package sets up a 'masquerade mode' distcc client for gcc (including g++,
objc and gfortran) and clang/clang++.

After installing distcc-masq-client, please configure it by editing the file
/etc/distcc/hosts -- you should change '127.0.0.1' to the distcc host
specification for your servers.  This file sets the system-wide default.

Or you can configure distcc for a particular user by setting the DISTCC_HOSTS
environment variable in the user's profile, for example

  export DISTCC_HOSTS="bighost/4 tinyhost"

For details of the format of /etc/distcc/hosts and the DISTCC_HOSTS
environment variable, see 'man distcc', section 'HOST SPECIFICATIONS'.
