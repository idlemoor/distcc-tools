This package sets up a 'masquerade mode' distcc client for gcc (including g++,
objc and gfortran) and clang/clang++.

From Slackware 14.2 onwards, this package also integrates full support for
ccache (including ccache without distcc), although ccache is not enabled by
default (see below).


Configuring distcc

After installing distcc-masq-client, please configure it by editing the file
/etc/distcc/hosts -- you should change '127.0.0.1' to the distcc host
specification for your servers.  This file sets the system-wide default.

Or you can configure distcc for a particular user by setting the DISTCC_HOSTS
environment variable in the user's profile, for example

  export DISTCC_HOSTS="bighost/4 tinyhost"

For details of the format of /etc/distcc/hosts and the DISTCC_HOSTS
environment variable, see 'man distcc', section 'HOST SPECIFICATIONS'.


Configuring ccache

ccache is not enabled by default. You can configure it by editing the ccache
system config file /etc/ccache.conf.

* To enable ccache, edit /etc/ccache.conf and change the line
'disable = true' to 'disable = false'.

* To disable distcc, edit /etc/ccache.conf and delete the line
'prefix_command = /usr/bin/distcc'.

For alternative ways of configuring ccache options, please see 'man ccache',
section 'CONFIGURATION'.


Disabling distcc and ccache

To temporarily disable distcc, you can unset the DISTCC_HOSTS environment
variable.  (This is a change to the upstream behaviour, which would apply the
system-wide defaults if DISTCC_HOSTS is unset.)

  unset DISTCC_HOSTS

To temporarily disable ccache, you can set the CCACHE_DISABLE environment
variable.

  export CCACHE_DISABLE=true

To disable distcc-masq-client (both ccache and distcc) completely, you can
block execution of the system-wide profile script:

  chmod ugo-x /etc/profile.d/distcc-masq-client.*
